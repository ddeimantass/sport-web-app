# Simple web application
Web application done for genius sports.

## About
This is a very simple web application that fetches data from two web services and outputs them on the screen after formatting them.
The data are divided into two tables based on the data it is for: matches or teams. Matches table can be sorted asc or desc without refreshing the page.
Web services witch are given by genius sports are very unreliable, so this web app handles errors from them when at least one of the services is not reachable.

## How to use
Currently you can download it and run the web application on your localhost without any additional settings. (Tested on MAMP)
I will try to put it on Herok in the near future, for public use, without any need to download it.
